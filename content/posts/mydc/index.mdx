**Client/Company/Project type:** Personal Project

**Project date:** 2020

**My role:** From wire-framing to visual design


### About

"Make your day count" (MYDC) is a productivity app that aims to facilitate individuals to be better self by the following objectives:

1. helps you create goals, maintain progress and achieve your goals
2. inspires you by "success stories" who stick to their goals and realize them

### Story

This final version of MYDC incorporated with illustrations created by me is a makeover of a project I did during the UI/UX part-time course. During the course, we followed the curriculum to conduct some UX research. To be honest, those memories are dated and what I still have on my computer is a few bullet points for research insights.

**Research Insights**

- Make deals with friends with some punishment and rewards can be more motivational
- Set deadlines (primarily short term)
- Seeing others' progress can be motivational and inspiring, especially from friends
- Can search for a mentor ( who has been successful and completed the same goal for support and coaching )
- Success Stories can be a reference/inspirations, but not the core motivations

Before I redesign this productivity app, it used to be like below. I still remember I have completed quite a few screens to show the interactions and user flow in Figma during the course. Sadly, they were lost, and I could not find them back. All I got is the below single page of the app design for presentation sake on the last lesson.

After a year or so (?), I revisited this app and still found it interesting to work on it as a hobby project.


### **Key Feature Design Highlights**


#### Unique illustration is the trend

Stepping into 2021, the use of unique illustrations is common in popular apps, i.e. Headspace, Fabulous and Intellect, etc. Not to mention many websites are using illustrations in hero images. It's becoming a part of brand identity. The use of illustrations brings out the character and personality of the app or website. The audience can remember the brand or the digital product more quickly as people perceive images faster than words. Illustrations help storytelling as well and make the app more engaging. It also creates a friendly and fun environment for users to interact with.

That's why I want to incorporate original illustration into this app, to make it stand out from a sea of productivity apps.

#### Limited Timeline 


Based on the UX research insights, the deadline is what drives people to accomplish a goal. As a productivity and self-help books lover, I have also incorporated one of my favorite writers - James Clear's ideas, into this app. When it comes to making a habit sticks, I believe most of us have heard about the myth that it takes 21 days. However, to make a habit stays, it actually requires 66 days.

> "On average, it takes more than 2 months before a new behavior becomes automatic â€” 66 days to be exact."  - James Clear

> "It makes sense why the "21 Days" Myth would spread. It's easy to understand. The time frame is short enough to be inspiring, but long enough to be believable. And who wouldn't like the idea of changing your life in just three weeks?" - James Clear


In MYDC, there are 3 types of timelines the users can choose from. Starting from a 21-day as a "trial" to start with, and then a 66-day to make a habit stick. Last but not least, an unlimited option to provide a flexible alternative to users.
