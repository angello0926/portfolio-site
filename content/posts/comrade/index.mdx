**Client/Company/Project type:** Comrade

**Project date:** 2018

**My role:** Entire mobile app design from wire-framing to visual design


### About

Comrade is a gamified social platform that allow users to find games to join, organize games and upgrade their skills through online progress tracking and offline training programs.

When Comrade reached out to me, they shared their vision on this mobile app. They are looking for a UI designer to transform their idea into a solid digital product. They were very eager to get this off the ground and launched it as soon as possible.

### The Problem

Football players have the problem that they find it hard to find games to join as it depends on your existing social network in real life. Moreover, when it comes to hosting the game, the hosts don't have a systematic way to manage the match and participants.

The solution is to build an all-in-one platform to join and host games easily.

### The Challenge

The client has a very clear vision and requirements in their mind, which helped drastically in the whole design process. My job is to fully incorporate their ideas into visual design and ensure that the resulted user flow is seamless and easy to use in a short project timeline. There are multiple user roles in one app - football players, football organizers, and those belong to both at the same time. Different user activities could happen in various stages of the games, from creation to the end of game. Finding ways to group related activities and try not to overwhelm the users on one screen is the biggest challenge.


### The Design Philosophy

> "What's the most important thing I should do if I want to make sure my Web site is easy to use?" The answer is simple. It's not "Nothing important should ever be more than two clicks away," or "Speak the user's language," or even "Be consistent." It's.. "Don't make me think!"  -- Steve Krug, Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability

The philosophy I keep reminding myself when I am doing whatever design project is "Don't make users think," inspired by "Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability," written by Steve Krug, a popular and classic book on UI/UX. It doesn't only apply to websites but to all digital products. Thus, throughout the whole design process, the sole goal is to do all the thinking as much as possible to avoid designing interfaces that require users to think.


### The Process
![The Process](./the-process.png)

Below is an overview of the **actual** project timeline. It took around 3 months to finish.

**Discovery Phase ( 2 weeks)**

- Alignment of the final user requirements

**Definition Phase ( 2 weeks )**

- Define User flows & user stories documents
- Gathering feedback from clients
- Finalize user flows and user stories

**Design Phase (6 weeks )**

- Draft wireframes
- UX testing with clients
- Revise wireframes design to incorporate UX testing feedback
- Produce final user interface design mockups
- Review mockups
- Revise wireframes design to incorporate mockups feedback

**Development Support Phase (2 weeks )**

- Resolve design issues that arise during development and answer questions from development teams about specified design solutions.

### **Key Feature Design Highlights**

#### Onboarding is the first impression.

Onboarding is where a user first meets the app. The first impression brings the essence of this app. Fluid and dynamic shapes are added to the first screen to bring out Comrade's fun and energetic vibes.

At the same time, the onboarding process should be painless and easy to register so that they can explore the app as soon as possible. To register, we just need the user to fill in minimal and essential information. We don't ask the users many questions or set up their profiles at this stage to make the process quick and hassle-free.

#### Creating a match should be as fun as the reality but more effortless.

I always believe that nobody likes filling forms. However, filling out forms could be the most frequent activity we have encountered in the digital experience. As a UI designer, I want to make filling forms fun and smooth. It should not be overwhelming. It is tough to navigate to different blanks when it comes to a mobile app if all questions are jammed into a tiny screen. That's why I designed it to be one step at a time. Instead of presenting it as a form, it should be more like an instructed journey. At the end of this journey, a congratulatory exclamation for completing a task could give the user a little surprise.

To add a little bit of fun to the process, users can choose the football wear color for this match to mimic the reality experience.

#### A little bit of customization can enhance the user experience.

Football players can create or join football clubs in Comrade. Five theme colors are introduced to users for their club to enhance the user experience. The default color is Comrade green. The club manager can choose a color that can bring out the energy of the club. When different clubs join the exact match, the color could be used to identify each party.

#### Use of visual dividers to organize content

"Kickoff" screen is where football players can create, manage and join a match. For each activity, it could have a lot of follow-up steps involved. Lines and titles are used to separate different sections to make things clear. In each section, the visual elements used are different to make each section distinguishable, i.e., circle buttons with icons used for match management, photos with text buttons used for creating different types of games, and a slidable card section used for joining matches.

#### Help the users know what to focus

The brand color - Comrade green is only used on the action buttons or important details, i.e. time and date of the match, final results of the game. By contrasting the brand color and the dark blue, users know what to focus on in an informative screen.

#### Lesson Learnt

It could have done better if I had initiated the UX research phase and incorporated it into the timeline to make my design decisions more informed and validated. I only found out how important it is after I attended the UX course later.

#### In the future

Comrade is launched and available in Google and Apple app store! I am looking forward to seeing Comrade evolve and getting users' feedback on this fantastic app!
